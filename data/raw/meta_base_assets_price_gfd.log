"_SPXD","S&P 500/Cowles Composite Price Index (w/GFD extension)","Stock Indices - Composites","United States Dollar","United States",,,,,,,"Index Number","Units","Stock","none","Monthly From Jan 1871 To Jan 1918<BR>Weekly From Jan 1918 To Dec 1927<BR>Daily From Jan 1928 To Apr 2020<BR>","For Data before 1871, please see the file GFUS100MPD<br />After the Dow Jones Averages, the second most historically extensive indices are the Standard and Poor's indices.  Whereas the Dow Jones averages were weighted by price, from the beginning, the S&P indices were weighted by capitalization.  The original indices were introduced by the Standard Statistics Corporation in 1923 covering 233 stocks in 26 sectors.  Data were calculated on a weekly basis back to 1918.  The daily indices were introduced in 1928 and consisted of a 90-stock average including 50 industrials, 20 rails and 20 utilities.  Data were calculated on a weekly basis back to 1926 and 1927.  <br />The Standard and Poor's Composite combines a number of different indices. From 1791 to 1801, GFD has calculated an equal-weighted index using data from 7 banks (Union National Bank of Boston, Massachusetts National Bank of Boston, the First Bank of the United States, Bank of the State of New York, Bank of Pennsylvania, Bank of South Carolina, and the Bank of America), 3 insurance companies (New York Insurance Company, Insurance Co. of Pennsylvania, Insurance Co. of North America) and two transport companies (Philadelphia and Lancaster Turnpike Company and Schuylkill Permanent Bridge Company).<br />Using Walter B. Smith and Arthur H. Cole, Fluctuations in American Business, 1790-1860, Cambridge: Harvard Univ. Press, 1935, the index combines the monthly price indexes of Bank stocks (1802-1815, Bank and Insurance Stocks (February 1815-December 1845), and Rails (1834-1862) from Smith and Cole, ibid.: and Railroads (1863-1870) from Frederick R. Macaulay, The Movements of Interest Rates, Bond Yields and Stock Prices in the United States Since 1856, New York: National Bureau of Economic Research, 1938.  This data is available in USMACRRM<br />GFD has used Smitha nd Cole's data on banks from 1802 to 1833.  Between 1834 and 1863, the file USCFALLM provides data from Smith and Cole. Beginning in 1871, the Cowles/Standard and Poor's Composite index of stocks is used.  The Standard and Poor's indices were first calculated in 1918, and the Cowles Commission back-calculated the series to 1871 using the Commercial and Financial Chronicle. For more information, see Standard and Poor's, Security Price Index Record, New York: Standard and Poor's, 2000 and Cowles Commission for Research in Economics, Common-Stock Indexes, 2nd ed., Bloomington: Principia Press, 1939.<br />High-low-close are available since January 1930 except for 1/2/41-7/30/46, 2/28/47-3/5/47, 10/24/47-10/28/47, 3/5/48-3/10/48, 5/6/49-5/11/49, 12/23/49-1/23/52, 6/27,30/1952, 9/5,8,9/1952.<br />The 90-stock Composite was calculated from 1926 through February 1957 when S&P introduced the S&P 500 stock average including 425 industrials, 25 rails and 50 utilities, weighting the index substantially in favor of the industrials.  S&P did not calculate the 500-stock index prior to March 1957, but used the old 90-share index (as well as the old 50 industrials, 20 rails and 20 utilities indices) to extend the data back to 1928.  The daily closes listed in the Security Price Index Record consist of the 90 stock averages adjusted to the new 1941/43 base from 1926 through February 1957, and the 500 stock averages starting in March 1957.  Similarly, the weekly/monthly data for these indices uses the 90 stock average, rather than the more extensive indices of industrials that included 400 stocks, and were calculated on a weekly rather than a daily basis.<br />The indices were revised again on July 1, 1976 when the rail index was dropped, and was replaced by the Transportation index, and a Financial Index was added.  Until that time, financial shares had been excluded from the S&P 500 because many were over-the-counter stocks making it difficult to calculate exact prices for the averages.  The components were changed from 425 industrials, 60 utilities and 15 rails to 400 industrials, 40 utilities, 20 transportation and 40 financial stocks in 1976.  On April 6, 1988, exact numerical allocations were abandoned allowing the sectoral composition of the S&P 500 index to change as new stocks were removed and added to the S&P 500. Data for the S&P 500 index is theoretical through 1983 and actual, real-time data from January 3, 1984 on. <br /><br /> Where possible, we have included high-low-close data for the indices, which meant readjusting the data for the period prior to March 1957 to the old indices.  High-low-close are currently available for 1930-1941, September 1946-December 1949, and beginning in January 1956.  Other dates have the close only. The primary sources for these data are Standard Statistics Corp., Base Book, New York: Standard Statistics Corp., 1931, Standard and Poor's Security Price Index Record, New York: Standard and Poor's (1940, 1941, 1948, 1955, 1957, 1962, and biannually since then), Standard and Poor's, Outlook, New York: Standard and Poor's (published weekly) and Standard and Poor's, Statistical Service, New York: S&P.  For a detailed history of the components of both the 90 and the 500 stock averages see the current and past issues of the biannual Security Price Index Record published by Standard and Poor's. <br />The original 500 share indices included 90-95% of the capitalization of the New York Stock Exchange providing the most comprehensive index of stocks then available; however, the rapid expansion in Nasdaq and growth in the NYSE has meant that the S&P indices now represent a smaller proportion of total market capitalization than in the past. The Wilshire 5000, Russell 3000 and Investor's Business Daily 6000 all cover substantially more shares than the S&P 500. Nevertheless, the S&P 500 still represents about 75% of the stock market's capitalization.  To update their index, S&P introduced a 400-share Mid-cap index (which was calculated back to 1981), in June 1991, and then introduced a Small Cap 600-share index in October 1994, which was calculated back to December 31, 1993.  The 1500-share Supercomposite was introduced in July of 1995 and calculated back to December 31, 1993.  In January 2002, S&P introduced the S&P 1000 which includes all the stocks in the S&P 400 Midcap and S&P 600 Small Cap Index. Beginning in March 2004, S&P began adjusting their indices so they would reflect the free float on their stock indices rather than the total capitalization.  The free float method reduces the influence of stocks such as Wal-Mart for which 40% of the stock is privately held and not publicly traded.<br />Volume data are for the stocks traded on the NYSE, not for the S&P 500 stocks.",,

The index is weekly until 1953 and daily thereafter.  The Fed Funds Rate was a variable rate or range throughout the 1970s.  Only in 1990 did the Fed make the Fed Funds rate a reliable target rate whereby it could influence monetary policy. On January 9, 2003, the Fed revised the discount rate, introducing two rates.   Primary credit is available to generally sound depository institutions on a very short-term basis, typically overnight, at a rate above the Federal Open Market Committee's target rate for federal funds. Depository institutions are not required to seek alternative sources of funds before requesting occasional short-term advances of primary credit. The Federal Reserve expects that, given the above-market pricing of primary credit, institutions will use the discount window as a backup rather than a regular source of funding. Secondary credit is available to depository institutions not eligible for primary credit. It is extended on a very short-term basis, typically overnight, at a rate that is above the primary credit rate.   Secondary credit is available to meet backup liquidity needs when its use is consistent with a timely return to a reliance on market sources of funding or the orderly resolution of a troubled institution. Secondary credit may not be used to fund an expansion of the borrower's assets. The secondary credit program entails a higher level of Reserve Bank administration and oversight than the primary credit program; a Reserve Bank obtains sufficient information about a borrower's financial condition and reasons for borrowing to ensure that an extension of secondary credit is consistent with the purpose of the facility.   This rate is a business day series and should not be used to derive  frequency averages - a 7-day daily discount rate would be appropriate.  The discount rate refers to the simple interest rate at which depository  institutions borrow from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.",,

See also David, Paul A. and Solar, Peter, ""A Bicentenary Contribution to the History of the Cost of Living in America,"" Research in Economic History (1977), pp. 1-80.<br />Notes: This index is based a combination of four indices. David and Solar are used from 1789 to 1820. From 1820 through 1874, the annual cost-of-living index calculated by the Federal Reserve Bank is used. From 1875 until 1912, it uses a monthly Index of General Prices calculated by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which was weighted between wholesale commodity prices (20%) Wage payments (35%), the Cost of Living (35%) and Rents (10%). From 1913 on, the Bureau of Labor's Consumer Price Index is used. For information on how the prices of individual goods have changed, see Scott Derks, ed., The Value of a Dollar, Lakeville, CT: Grey House Publishing, 1999.<br />The Consumer Price Index (CPI), 1982-84=100, is calculated on the basis of a market basket of 305 entry level items representing all goods and services purchased for everyday living by all residents in urban areas. These residents include about 87 percent of the total civilian noninstitutional population, including wage earners and clerical workers, professional, managerial, and technical workers, short-term workers, the self-employed, the unemployed, retirees, and others not in the labor force. <br />For most item categories, representing approximately 61 percent of the total expenditure weight, basic indexes are compiled using a geometric mean formula. For the remaining item categories, basis indexes are computed using a modified Laspeyres methodology<br />Each month 80,000 price quotations are obtained from approximately 23,000 outlets. About 50,000 housing units are contacted to collected data on rents. Prices are usually collected during the first 18 working days (Monday-Friday) of the month. Food, rent, utilities, and some other items are priced monthly in all urban areas. Most other items are priced monthly in three large urban areas, and every second month in other areas. Most pricing is conducted by personal interview; some pricing takes place by telephone. The prices include any applicable taxes, discounts and rebates. <br />The weights for the CPI are derived from the Consumer Expenditure Surveys for 1993-95, and the average for those 3 years. Historically weights have been revised once every 10 years; however, starting in 2002, weights will be revised every other year. Seasonally adjusted indices are also published.",,

The Dresden Convention of July 30, 1838 made the first attempt to link together the German monetary systems on a silver standard.  On January 24, 1857, The Germanic Monetary Agreement made the silver Thaler the monetary unit of the Northern German Confederation. On December 4, 1871, the minting of silver coins was suspended and the mark replaced the previous Germanic currencies at rates of 10 new Marks = 3.33 Thaler = 5.50 Gulden = 8 Marks = 5.33 Hamburg/Luebeck Schillings. The gold standard was established on July 12, 1873.  Prior to that the Hamburg mark was the primary currency for “Germany.” Exchange rates for Hamburg are available back to 1794. Germany abandoned silver for gold in 1871.  <br />  Four series are provided for Germany during the 20th Century.  The first series is the pre-inflation exchange rate.  Data for the Reichsmark is used beginning in March 1873 (prior to that date, London`s exchange rate for Frankfurt can be used. <br />The Rentenmark was introduced on October 15, 1923.  It was guaranteed by gold-linked mortgages on landed properties. The Dawes Committee set up a plan to stabilize the currency, and on August 30, 1924 the Reichsmark replaced the Rentenmark at 1 Reichsmark = 1 Rentenmark = 1 trillion paper Marks = 1 old gold Mark = 358.422939 milligrams of fine gold = 4.2 US Dollars. Data on the Reichsmark begins in January 1924, and weekly data for the gold Reichsmark can be found in XRDEMRKW.  During World War II, exchange rates were for official purposes only, and had little practical meaning.    <br />Beginning in 1931, Germany created different categories of the blocked mark for the sale of assets such as the Kreditsperrmark, Auswanderersperrmark, Effektensperrmark, Notensperrmark, and Registersperrmark, Konversionsperrmark. Two series have been provided which better reflect changes in the market value of the mark during the 1930s and World War II.  The first is the Registermark (XRDERM), which was used for tourists and investments made in Germany, and the second is Effektensperrmark, which was used for the sale of securities in Germany.  The League of Nations provided gold parity values for these exchange rates in London and Zurich, and they have been converted into dollar rates.  Quarterly data are given for III and IV/1943.   <br />When the German Reich occupied countries, they usually created a new exchange rate of the former currency into Reichsmark, which was used more for official than practical purposes.  For more information on exchange rates during World War II, see the League of Nations Yearbooks for 1937 to 1944/45, which provide information on exchange rates for both Germany and occupied countries.   <br />Once the allies liberated occupied countries, new official exchange rates were introduced, though these often varied significantly from black market rates.  The Allies used an exchange rate of 10 Reichsmark to the dollar beginning in October 1944 and introduced the Allied Militarbehorde Mark, which was eventually converted into the Deutsche Mark.  Black market rates begin in July 1946. On June 20, 1948, the currency was reformed with salaries and pensions converted at 1:1 and all other payments converted at 10 Reichsmark to the Deutsche Mark. The exchange rate was initially set at 1 U.S. Dollar = 3.33 Deutsche Mark, revised to 4.20 Deutsche Mark on September 18, 1949. A special currency, the Sperrmark, was created on March 31, 1951 to enable foreigners to purchase German securities.  The Sperrmark hit a low of 8.06 Sperrmark to the U.S. Dollar in December 1951, and the Sperrmark accounts were consolidated in September 1954 making them convertible. The mark was revalued to 1 U.S. Dollar = 4 Deutsche Mark on March 6, 1961 and to 3.66 Deutsche Mark on October 29, 1969. <br />The East German Mark Coupon was introduced on June 24, 1948 at a rate of 10 Reichsmark = 1 Coupon Mark, with different rates for banknotes, deposits, prices, salaries and taxes. The Ostmark (DDM) replaced the Coupon Mark on July 20, 1948 at 1 Deutschmark = 1.25 Ostmark. The basic rate was changed to 1 U.S. Dollar = 2.22 Ostmark on October 29, 1953 and 4.20 Ostmark on January 7, 1958. When the German Mark floated in July 1973, the exchange rate was reset to 1 Ostmark = 1 Deutschemark where it remained until July 1, 1990 when the Staatsbank ceased to exist and the Bundesbank took over all monetary responsibilities.  Data for the Ostmark can be found in XRDDMM (DDM/278). <br />  Data for the Hamburg Agio (IPDEUHM) is given from January 1687 to December 1785.  The Agio showed the spread between the official value of the Hamburg Schellingen Banco and the actual value for coins.  A value of 5.25 means a 5.25% premium, i.e. it took 105.25 Scellingen Current to pay a debt of 100 Schellingen Banco",,

Before 1793, colonial currencies rather than the U.S. dollar were used for trade between London and the U.S. We have converted the colonial currencies to the British exchange rate in order that a long-term exchange rate can be presented.  The Massachusetts Shilling is used from 1640 to 1699 and the Pennsylvania Shilling is used from 1700 to 1792. During the Revolutionary War, states adopted depreciation schedules for the Continental Dollar, and the Pennsylvania depreciation schedule is used from 1777 to 1781. A conversion rate of 3 Dollars to 8 Pennsylvania Shillings is used in 1792.  Another problem lies with the civil war period when the United States went off the gold standard. Although The U.S. was off the gold standard from 1862 to 1864, a gold premium on the dollar can be used to determine the equivalent value of the paper and gold dollar. The gold value of the dollar is provided in the “high” column, the paper value of the dollar in the “low” column and the market rate on the dollar in the “close” column.  <br />The United Kingdom adopted the gold standard, in principle, on June 22, 1816, and the UK departed from gold in June 1914 when World War I began.

It consisted of ten bonds from four groups: high-grade rails, second-grade rails, utility bonds and industrial bonds.  The index was discontinued in its existing form on June 30, 1976 because of the reduction in the number of rail bonds and the new DJBA, which excludes railroad bonds, was introduced. <br />A new Dow Jones Bond Average replaced the old bond average of 40 bonds in July 1976. The old bond average used a composite of 40 bonds and four sub-indices of 10 high-grade rails, 10 second-grade rails, 10 public utilities, and 10 industrials.  The shrinkage in the number of railway bonds required the computation of a new average.
